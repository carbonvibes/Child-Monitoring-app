# Child Monitoring Application

## About :
<div align='justify'>
This app is our SSRP project which solves a major fear among parents, child safety in roads. While parents permit their children to ride bicycle there are a lot of hazards for the children in riding a bicycle. They may overspeed or cross the boundary specified by their parents, carelessly or in the worst case may even fall of the cycle. Most of the time this is casual and normal but accidents are caused when we are careless about these normal mishaps. Thus, to ensure children's safety and parent's confidence we came up with this app. </div>
